# Exemplator

Exemplator is a Java coding assistant that takes a function/code as input and searches GitHub for code snippets that use that function/code.
Thus you see how other people used the method/code you were looking for. 

The idea is to have a tool that quickly explains how APIs are used through examples and not through mediocre documentation.
